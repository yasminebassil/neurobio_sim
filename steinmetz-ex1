# Answer to Exercise 1: Spike Counts

# Write some code to see which area got more overall spikes. You want to count 
# the ones in each matrix.

#Hints: 
  # you could use np.nonzeros
  # OR
  # You could write a for loop that goes through each row and column and checks 
  # if it's a 1 or 0, then gives you some sort of input. 
 
 ____________________________________________________________________

# For each of the 111 rows: you want to run through each row and check each value in each column 
# to see whether it's a 1 or a 0. 

vis_data.shape
ans = np.nonzero(vis_data)
vis_data[2,181]
len(ans[0])

# Answer:
# This vis_data matrix is 111x250, which means that there are 27,750 entries. Out of 
# these number of entries, 411 of them are 1's. There were 411 spikes in the 
# total visual neurons over time. 

ans2 = np.nonzero(non_vis_data)
len(ans2[0])

# Answer:
# This non_vis_data matrix is 111x250, which means that there are 27,750 entries. 
# Out of these number of entries, 590 of them are 1's. There were 590 spikes 
# in the total visual neurons over time.
