# Exercise 1 Solution


To find the length of the variable t, you can use the `len()` function.
```
len(t)
```

To print this outcome, you can use the `print()` function.
```
print(len(t))
```

Now, if you want to be fancy about it and communicate this in a full sentence, you can add more words to communicate what it is you're printing.

```
print('The length of vector t = ' + str(len(t)))
```

<i> Can you explain how this last part works? Take a moment to try to understand this last chunk of code and what `str()` does.</i>
