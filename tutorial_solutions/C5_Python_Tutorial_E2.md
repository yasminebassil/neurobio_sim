# Exercise 2 Solution

To create a Python "dictionary," you want to use curvy brackets to make a "list" with a specific format. This was explained in one of the linked Python tutorials in the Google Colab notebook. Find the solution below. 

```
my_dictionary = {'Potassium Conductance': g_K, 'Sodium Conductance': g_Na, 'Leak Conductance': g_L, 'Potassium Reversal Potential': E_K, 'Sodium Reversal Potential': E_Na, 'Leak Reversal Potential': E_L}
print (my_dictionary)
```
