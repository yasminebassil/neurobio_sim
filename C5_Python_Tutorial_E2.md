# Exercise 2 Solution

To create a Python "dictionary," you want to use curvy brackets to make a "list" with a specific format. This was explained in one of the linked Python tutorials in the Google Colab notebook. Find the solution below. 

```
my_dictionary = {'g_K': 36.0, 'g_Na': 120.0, 'g_L': 0.3, 'E_K': -77.0, 'E_Na': 50.0, 'E_L': -54.387}
print (my_dictionary)
```
