# Exercise 2 Solution

To create a Python "dictionary," you want to use curvy brackets to make a "list" with a specific format. This was explained in one of the linked Python tutorials in the Google Colab notebook. Find the solution below. 

```
my_dictionary = {'g_K': g_K, 'g_Na': g_Na, 'g_Leak': g_L, 'E_K': E_K, 'E_Na': E_Na, 'E_leak': E_leak}
print (my_dictionary)
```
